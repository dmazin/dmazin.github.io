    Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing?</p>
    <p>
    <p>
    I am not asking those questions. I did not just wake up from a coma. But maybe you are asking those questions, about me.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am an SRE in London. I have been working in tech since 2012.
    </p>
    I was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1990.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here you will find my investigations, opinions, and stories about Unix things, observability, database administration, and, generally, development and infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am also interested in the history of technology (especially computing) and online communities, and text entry systems (like autocorrect and T9).
    </p>
    <p>
    I have lived in Los Angeles, Berkeley (California), Flagstaff (Arizona), and Lambertville (New Jersey).
