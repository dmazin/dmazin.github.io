I am pleasantly surprised that I gained a number of subscribers over the past week. I just wanted to say hello to thank you for following.

If you are here for essays like [Reddit is OpenAI’s moat](/2023/06/14/reddit-moat.html), I suggest my 2017 essay about autocorrect called [Pink Lexical Slime](/2017/12/12/pink-lexical-slime.html). It took a year to research and write. In that essay, I showed how autocorrect was changing English spelling. I extrapolated how predictive text could amplify bias and alter English style. Of course, predictive text turned into large language models, making the issues way bigger. I should write a big update to that essay at some point.

Please beware that by following me, you are exposing yourself to highly technical content about Linux and databases like [What’s Writing to My Brand-new Disk?](/2023/04/06/whats-writing-to-my-disk.html). 

Again, thanks for following me.

By the way, feel free to say hi at dm@cyberdemon.org!
