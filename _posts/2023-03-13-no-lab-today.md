Just a heads up: today, I started diving into why sysbenchâ€™s random file write benchmark reports disk write throughput much lower than the throughput reported by monitoring tools like iostat. There is some weird shit going on, so it will take extra time to explain it well.

Also, I renamed the site from archvile.net to cyberdemon.org. This way, I can still feel embarrassed when I tell people about it at parties, but at least this way they will understand what I am saying.
