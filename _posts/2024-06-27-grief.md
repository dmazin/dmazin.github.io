description: On hiding your grief
---
This post isn't technical, nor very long, but I’m posting it anyway. The content of the post should make it obvious why I want to post it.

But now I understand it — when you lose someone (at least when I lost someone), you want everyone to know. You want to say it to every person you speak to.

So the Victorians had it right — they gave the mourners permission to loudly proclaim their grief.

"A single person is missing for you, and the whole world is empty. But one no longer has the right to say so aloud."
